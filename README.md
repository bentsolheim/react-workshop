# React-Workshop
This is the code used in the course **Robust web applications with React/Redux**.

## Getting started
Prerequisites:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Once you have the necessary tools you can clone the repository to a working directory on your machine by running:

`git clone https://github.com/rudfoss/react-workshop.git ./`

The clean project without any code files (yet) should now be on your machine. You can now open VSCode in that folder by running `code .` from the terminal.

## VSCode extensions
Allthough these are not technically required you might consider installing some of these extensions. You can find them by searcing for them by name in the Extensions palette in VSCode

- ESLint
- Settings Sync
- vscode-icons
