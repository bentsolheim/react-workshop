# React-Workshop
This is the code used in the course **Robust web applications with React/Redux**.

## Getting started
**Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Open a terminal and clone this repository into a local folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudfoss/react-workshop.git
```

The last thing we need to do before we begin is to install all the necessary dependencies. Open a terminal in your project root folder and run:
```bash
npm i # short for npm install
```

## Recommended tools
Throughout the course we will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You are free to use any IDE you like, but the project is set up with some additional tools that will seamlessly integrate with VSCode should you decide to use it.

If you are using VSCode you should also consider installing these extensions:

- ESLint
- vscode-icons
- Emojisense ðŸ˜¸

To install them start VSCode, navigate to the Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X on Windows) and search for each one. After installing them restart VSCode.

## Additional things enabled by using VSCode

- Code snippets for quickly scaffolding components.
- Auto-fix eslint errors on file save.
